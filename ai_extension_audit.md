# Whiskey AI Extension Audit Report

## Key Findings

### 1. Missing Import for Type Hints
- **Issue**: `extension.py` uses `Application` type hint in `ai_extension(app: Application)` but never imports it
- **Fix**: Should import `Whiskey` from core module (Application is legacy alias)

### 2. Non-existent API Methods
- **Issue**: AI extension calls `app.add_scope()` which doesn't exist in current Whiskey API
- **Current API**: Scopes are managed through Container, not through add_scope method
- **Fix**: Need to refactor scope registration approach

### 3. Outdated Patterns
- AI extension still uses some patterns that may not align with the Pythonic API improvements
- Should leverage the new dict-like container API more effectively

### 4. Type Safety Issues
- Several protocol definitions could be improved with better typing
- Missing proper imports for type checking

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. Fix Import Issues
```python
# Add to extension.py
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from whiskey import Whiskey

# Change function signature
def ai_extension(app: 'Whiskey') -> None:
```

### 2. Update Scope Registration
Instead of `app.add_scope()`, use the container's built-in scope management:
```python
# Current (broken)
app.add_scope("conversation", ConversationScope)

# Suggested approach
# Register ConversationScope as a service instead
app.singleton(ConversationScope, key="conversation_scope")
```

### 3. Simplify Manager Classes
The manager classes (ModelManager, ToolManager, AgentManager) could be simplified:
- Use Container's dict-like API for storage
- Leverage type hints better
- Remove redundant instance tracking

### 4. Better Integration with Core Decorators
- Use `@inject` decorator consistently
- Align with Whiskey's automatic injection patterns
- Remove unnecessary complexity

### 5. Improve Type Protocols
- Add proper return type annotations
- Use TypedDict for configuration objects
- Better async type hints

### 6. Extension Registration Pattern
Consider updating how decorators are added:
```python
# Current
app.add_decorator("model", model)

# Could be simplified since decorators can be standalone
# and use the app instance directly
```

### 7. Remove Redundant Service Registration
```python
# Current - registers twice
agent_manager.register(name, cls)
app.container[cls] = cls

# Should just use container registration
app.component(cls, tags={"agent", name})
```

### 8. Align with Core API Patterns
- Use `Whiskey` instead of `Application`
- Follow the dict-like container patterns
- Use built-in scope management
- Leverage automatic injection without Annotated[T, Inject()]

## Priority Actions

1. **High Priority**: Fix import issues and type hints
2. **High Priority**: Remove/update non-existent API calls (add_scope)
3. **Medium Priority**: Simplify manager classes
4. **Medium Priority**: Improve type safety
5. **Low Priority**: Refactor for better core integration

## Benefits of Updates

- Better compatibility with core Whiskey API
- Improved type safety and IDE support
- Simpler, more Pythonic code
- Easier maintenance
- Better performance through proper use of container
